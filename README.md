# Yet another daily wordle

Yes, it exists many wordle games already. Therefore i have created one more. The objective is simple: guess the hidden five-letter word. With each guess, you'll receive feedback on which letters are correct and in the right position (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are not in the word at all. It's a brain-teasing game that will test your word-finding skills. Because the word are not revealed after a given amount of tries, and all kind of uncommon words can be the word of the day, there are no limit in number of guesses. A simple algorithm picks out a new word every day, have fun!
